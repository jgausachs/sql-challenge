# SQL-challenge
Submission for Challenge 9 - SQL

## Data Modelling
Submission of the Entity Relationship Diagram can be found under folder 'sql-challenge/EmployeeSQL/':
- File 'ERD_clip_v3.png':  
  contains a clip of the logic diagram as generated with QuickDBD
- File 'ERD_code_v3.txtERD_code_v3.txt':  
  contains the code used to generate the diagram  
Note we assumed serial keys for tables 'dept_emp' and 'dept_manager' in the ERD model; whereas in the final implmentation we created composite keys for those tables instead.
